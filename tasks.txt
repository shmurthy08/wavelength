You are a senior frontend software developer. You have been given this project and the details of the project are in the readme.

Your main task is to ensure the divs, spacings, and displays are accurately positioned within the web browser.
Navbars cover up some text and the components are too high. So please analyze the codebase and ensure proper spacing.
After this is covered we need proper creation of creating wavelengths, tuning into them (i.e subscribing) which might require caching or storing information to supabase.

At the moment I'm not able to tune into wavelengths and post things. Please ensure this is working by modifying or creating files as needed.
