### Issue: Error Creating Wavelength: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" in CreateWavelength.jsx
Description: When attempting to create a new wavelength in CreateWavelength.jsx using the provided form, the application returns an error “Failed to create wavelength.” The error trace indicates that the issue occurs when accessing the newly created wavelength's id. Even though we have guards in place to check for a valid user, it appears that the wavelength creation or the subsequent response does not return the expected data with an id property.

Steps to Reproduce:

Sign in with a valid user account.
Navigate to the CreateWavelength page.
Fill in the form and submit.
Observe the error in the console: “Error creating wavelength: Error: Failed to create wavelength.”
Expected Behavior: The wavelength should be created successfully, returning an object that contains an id. Then, the user should be navigated to the new wavelength view.

Possible Fix:

Verify that the Supabase call to create a wavelength returns the expected data.
Add further error logging and checks in WavelengthContext.js createWavelength function to determine if the returned data is missing the id.
Ensure that the AuthContext provides a valid user with an id at all times.
Additional Context:

Operating System: Windows
Workspace: c:\Users\Shree Murthy\Desktop\Shree Murthy\Coding\wavelength
CreateWavelength.jsx references createWavelength() from WavelengthContext.jsx.
The error is thrown in handleSubmit of CreateWavelength.jsx when the response does not include data.id.
